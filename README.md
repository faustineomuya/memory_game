# The Memory Game 
Is a **Udacity Front-End track Nanodegree** project.
The memory game is a game built to test the players memory and concentration ability. All the player has to do is to match the cards into pairs of eight to complete the game.

## Project Overview
This project aims to put my CSS, HTML and JS skills to the test by building a fully functional browser based card matching game.

## How to Play
The game's objective is to match all the pairs of cards using minimal number of moves and time.

## How I built the Memory Game
Starter code was provided to me by Udacity. It was however a static version of the game.
To convert the project from a static to an interactive game, i used Vanilla Js and some styling. This involved
1. Creating a deck that holds the cards
2. Creating Cards that hold icons
3. Adding icons to every card
4. Shuffling the cards whenever the game started
5. Adding a timer to record time-taken to complete the game
6. Adding a rating function to rate the player based on number of moves made
7. Creating a modal that appeared whenever the game ended displaying the player statistics 

## Game Dependencies
* [Font Awesome](https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.6.1/css/font-awesome.min.css) for the Card icons.
